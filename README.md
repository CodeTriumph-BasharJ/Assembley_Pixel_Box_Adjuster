This program adjusts the position of a box displayed using Bitmap tool in Mars assembler and controlling the position of the box using "s", "w", "a", and "d" keys for 
down, up, left, and right movements respectively using Mars MIMO Keyboard tool. The space bar changes the color of the box back and forth.
